# The Application 

## Desciption

[APPNAME] is a home-inventoring application designed to help people better understand what they have, for insurance and net-worth reasons, as well as in order to sell items in an organized fashion. [COMPANYNAME] By inventoring all the items that are in one's possession we can: 
* Identify items that are useful to us 
* Identify items that could be worth selling 
* Assess if an item is worth the space it occupies ( i.e. "my rent is $1,000/month, and item x occupies 1/100 of that space, therefor it is costing $10/month)
* Keep track of license information 
* Keep track of purchase information
