# README 

This is a react web application that is designed to work in conjunctuion with the corresponding server (also in this repository), and should be run concurrently. 

## Getting Started 

Before you can run **Sorted**, you must install the dependencies: 
  * In the root of the `web-ui` (current) directory, run (via the command line) `npm install` 

Once the dependecies are installed, the application can be run by calling `npm start` in the root (current - `web-ui` folder). 
  * By default, the application will run on port `3000` and the server will run on port `4000`; changing either of these settings 
    may cause the application to break. 


## Credits 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
